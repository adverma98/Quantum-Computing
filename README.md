"# Quantum-Computing" 

This repo is for me to play around with various different softwware tools/libraries relating to quantum information and quantum computing. I really love this field, and I'm trying to learn more to prepare for my class next semester (Fall 2019) <b>Intro to Quantum Information</b> at Rutgers University.
